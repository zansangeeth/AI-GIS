# GIS AI Agent â€“ Spatial Analysis

This project is a simple web-based GIS tool that allows you to upload TopoJSON files, visualize them on an interactive map, and perform spatial analysis using natural language prompts.

## Features

- Upload and visualize TopoJSON/GeoJSON data on a map (powered by MapLibre GL JS)
- Analyze spatial relationships using prompts, e.g.:
  - `features within 10km of Hartlepool`
- See results highlighted on the map and in a tabular format
- Uses [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) for spatial analysis and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client) for data conversion

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zansangeeth/AI-GIS.git
